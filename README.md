The Odin Project's 1st Foundation Project

This is the first project of The Odin Project Foundations Curriculum.
This project is more focused into building website based on HTML, served as the one project that will fill the "requirement" to be submitted to The Odin Project's web. CSS and JS will be less used here, since the focus is more into HTML.
